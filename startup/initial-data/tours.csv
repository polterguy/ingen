1,"T-Rex Information","The Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore, with a massive skull, balanced by a long heavy tail.

Relative to its large and powerful hindlimbs, Tyrannosaurus forelimbs were short but unusually powerful for their size and had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures up to 12 meters in length, up to 3.5 meters tall at the hips, and according to most modern estimates 8 to 14 metric tons in weight.

Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size, it is still among the largest known land predators and is estimated to have exerted the largest bite force among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, armoured herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods.",1
2,"Brontosaurus Information","Brontosaurus had long thin necks, and small heads, adapted for a herbivorous lifestyle. It had a bulky heavy torso, and long whip-like tails. The various species lived during the Late Jurassic epoch in the Morrison Formation of North America, and went extinct by the end of the Jurassic. Adult individuals of Brontosaurus are estimated to weigh up to 15 tonnes, and measure up to 22 metres long.",2
