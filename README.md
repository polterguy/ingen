# Programming Contest

A programming contest initiated by the mods at [/r/shittyprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyprogramming/comments/8t2j1l/shittyprogramming_deathmatch_is_tonight_8pm_est/).
The idea is to implement the best solution for a specification we're given in the shortest possible time frame.
Neither me nor [my opponent](https://github.com/fascinatedBox/) knows what we're supposed to implement,
and the contest will last for some 2-3 hours, streamed in front of a live audience.
